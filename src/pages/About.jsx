                        <p>
                            During college lab hours, most social sites were blocked ‚Äî but the network was still active. One day, I wanted to chat
                            with a friend from another class, and we stumbled upon a clever workaround: <a href="https://codeshare.io" className="underline underline-offset-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codeshare.io</a>.
                            It let us share code live, so we just started messaging each other there.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-3">
                            That sparked our curiosity: what kind of tech allows this real-time interaction? We discovered <strong>WebRTC</strong>,
                            and that became the seed for PeerShare. What began as a hacky chat tool turned into a full-fledged peer-to-peer app
                            with secure <strong>1-on-1 chat</strong>, <strong>video calls</strong>, <strong>screen sharing</strong>, and <strong>file transfers</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mt-3">
                            PeerShare was born from a simple need ‚Äî and built with the drive to learn, experiment, and solve a real-world limitation with tech.

                            PeerShare uses WebRTC for direct communication between devices. That means:
